# Determination-of-Sample-Size-for-Estimating-Population-Mean-under-Stratified-Sampling-using-R-Shiny
This project studies the estimation of the population mean using stratified sampling. The population is divided into several strata based on relevant characteristics, and samples are drawn from each stratum.
An R Shiny application is developed to understand how sample size and allocation change with respect to sampling bias, cost, and time of data collection in each stratum.

**Objectives**

To estimate the required sample size for population mean estimation

To understand the importance of stratification in sampling

To study different sample allocation strategies

To analyze the effect of cost and time on sampling decisions

To visualize the design of the experiment

**Theoretical Background**
Stratified Sampling

Stratified sampling is a probability sampling method where the population is divided into homogeneous subgroups called strata. Samples are selected independently from each stratum.

This method improves precision when variability within strata is low and variability between strata is high.

Population Mean Estimation

The population mean is estimated by combining information from all strata. Each stratum contributes to the final estimate based on its size and characteristics.

Sampling Bias

Sampling bias represents the allowable deviation between the estimated mean and the true population mean. A smaller bias requires a larger sample size to achieve higher accuracy.

Sample Allocation in Stratified Sampling

Sample allocation determines how many units are selected from each stratum. Different allocation strategies help balance accuracy and feasibility.

Role of Cost and Time

In practical surveys, data collection cost and time may differ across strata. Ignoring these factors may lead to inefficient survey designs. Optimised allocation accounts for these constraints to ensure effective resource utilization.

Design of the Experiment

The experimental design is represented using graphical tools that show how the total sample is distributed across strata. This helps in understanding the sampling structure visually.

**Use of R Shiny**

The R Shiny application allows users to:

Input stratum-wise details

Specify sampling bias, cost, and time

View sample allocation results

Visualize experimental design interactively

**** Learning Outcomes****

Understanding of stratified sampling methodology

Insight into allocation strategies

Practical application of sampling theory

Experience with interactive statistical tools
